\section{Research Method}

To be able to define a research goal, this work started by a systematic literature review in order to know the state of the art and to recognize the requirements and challenges. In addition, industrial partners in robotics and mining industry to Addiva AB have been consulted in the matter, in order to achieve a better understanding of the real world challenges that each particular industry is facing with.

One prerequisite of the work was to use an already existing hardware system for the UWB radar. The second part of the literature review was mostly about understanding the existing hardware and its advantages and limitations. The research method used in this thesis was an induction method. It means that the experimental result leads to forming a theory. Series of experiments is performed and collected data was analyzed which resulted in scientific papers and better understanding of the system. This has been an iterative process as each result led to more knowledge which in turn resulted in new literature studies and set of experiments.
    
% The research goal is solving concrete problem so identifying the research goal was the first step.
