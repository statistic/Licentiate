	Abstract and Contribution:This paper compares two dominant Ultra Wide Band(UWB) radar technologies Impulse and M-sequence for static human being detection in free space. The hardware and software platform for each system is described separately. These two radar platform performances are tested in real conditions and the results show that M-sequence UWB radar is better suited for detecting the static human target in larger distances.
	
	Author's contribution:
	I have been the main author of this paper and a major part of the idea was mine. I have planned and performed the measurements with help of Radarbolaget that provided the hardware. I wrote most of the paper and analyzed the results.

	Abstract and Contribution: This paper presents an experimental comparison study of human movement and presence detection in different environments using ultra-wide-band (UWB) M-Sequence radar. The benchmarking measurements are made in an anechoic chamber and repeated in an open office environment. The wave forms of the background noise and scattered amplitudes of a human body are measured and compared. A set of detection algorithms and filters which are developed to track the human movement and presence is presented and the tracking results in these two environments are compared to each other.

	Author's contribution:
	I have been the main author of this paper. I have planned and performed the measurements with help of Delta that provided the semi-anechoic chamber. I wrote most of the paper and partly analyzed the results. I partly developed the signal processing algorithms and filters.

\subsection{Planned Publications}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item \textbf{Paper C} A journal article which will present the results by measuring the backscattering of a simple model for human body. A water tank and different sizes of water pipes will represent trunck, arms and legs. The measurement will be done in free space by UWB radar. The system as a whole for human detection solution will be studied in a controlled environment. The effect of antenna orientation in detection will be investigated. The experimental results will be compared with theory.
