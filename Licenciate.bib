@article{Dobson2003,
abstract = {Commercial vendors of human tracking systems tout benefits and diminish, dismiss, or deny any potential for abuse. Indeed, the benefits of location based services (LBS) are myriad, and human tracking is not all bad. However, the countless benefits of LBS are countered by social hazards unparalleled in human history. We explore possibilities for misuse that many would consider unethical. Our principal objectives are to forewarn the public, foster debate, and propose remedies. We focus primarily on hazards, reasoning that benefits get more than their due from commercial advertising, while hazards are ignored by vendors and, all too often, by public officials, as well. We describe the technologies and cite current products to demonstrate that the dangers are real, not imaginary. We illustrate the danger through realistic scenarios of potential enslavement applications. We advocate a rational response that acknowledges the benefits and inevitability of adoption along with an overwhelming need for safeguards. Finally, we propose a remedy that may prevent the most egregious abuses while, simultaneously, preserving most benefits.},

@article{Teixeira2010,
abstract = {An increasingly common requirement of computer systems is to extract information regarding the people present in an environment. In this article, we provide a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary survey of the existing literature, focusing mainly on the extraction of five commonly needed spatio- temporal properties: namely presence, count, location, track and identity. We discuss a new taxonomy of observable human properties and physical traits, along with the sensing modalities that can be used to extract them. We compare active vs. passive sensors, and single-modality vs. sensor fusion approaches, in instrumented vs. uninstrumented settings, surveying sensors as diverse as cameras, motion sensors, pressure pads, radars, electric field sensors, and wearable inertial sensors, among others. The goal of this work is to summarize the existing solutions from various disciplines, to guide the creation of new systems and point toward future research directions.},

abstract = {This paper describes the results of our evaluation of a pedestrian's radio wave reflection characteristics. The reflection characteristics of radio waves from a pedestrian were measured as part of the effort to improve the pedestrian detection performance of the radar sensor. A pedestrian's radio wave reflection intensity is low, at about 15-20dB less than that of the rear of a vehicle, and can vary by as much as 20dB. Evaluating these characteristics in detail is a prerequisite to the development of a radar sensor that is capable of detecting pedestrians reliably.},

On the first level, global spatial and temporal characteristics (normalized length and step duration) are generated. On the second level, a set of parameterized trajectories produce both the position of the body in space and the internal body configuration. This is performed for a standard structure and an average configuration of the human body.",

	abstract={A commonly used density model for radar clutter is chi-square for power, or, equivalently, Rayleigh for amplitude. However, for many modern high resolution radar systems, this density underestimates the tails of the measured clutter density. Log normal and Weibull distributions have proved to be better suited for the clutter in these high resolution radars. Generalizing the chi-square density by replacing it with the noncentral chi-square density and allowing the mean power level (the noncentrality parameter) to vary, we can both suitably shape the clutter density to produce larger tails and model the fluctuation of the average clutter power, commonly referred to as speckle. The resulting form, although appearing cumbersome, readily allows for efficient and accurate computations of the probability of detection in clutter},

abstract = {This paper describes the results of our evaluation of a pedestrian's radio wave reflection characteristics. The reflection characteristics of radio waves from a pedestrian were measured as part of the effort to improve the pedestrian detection performance of the radar sensor. A pedestrian's radio wave reflection intensity is low, at about 15-20dB less than that of the rear of a vehicle, and can vary by as much as 20dB. Evaluating these characteristics in detail is a prerequisite to the development of a radar sensor that is capable of detecting pedestrians reliably.},

Measurements of a commercially available UWB antenna performance in an anechoic chamber and in various indoor multipath environments were conducted. Comparisons of these measurement results indicate that while the human body creates a deep null (23.6 dB) in a light multipath environment, this null is drastically reduced (6.8 dB) in a dense multipath environment.},

We confirm known effects and conduct real-world experiments in a typical indoor human tracking scenario using 2.4 GHz time of flight (TOF) range measurements. We analyze the effect on the raw measurements and on the localization results using the localization algorithms Centroid, NLLS, MD-Min-Max, and Geo-n.

@phdthesis{WilliamCharlesSuski2012,
abstract = {This work is motivated by the problem of improving the accuracy of indoor ultra-wideband (UWB) position tracking through the study of the environment noise that affects such a system. Current systems can provide accuracy in the range of 30-100 cm in a small building, suitable for applications that require rough room-level precision such as asset tracking and surveillance. Our long-term goal is to improve the accuracy to 1 cm or better, expanding potential applications to telepresence, augmented reality, training and entertainment. This work investigates the possibility of systematically observing the measurement noise of an UWB position tracking system and building a map of it throughout a facility. In order to understand the effect of environment noise on UWB indoor positioning and in turn filter out the effects of this noise, it is important to have an idea of what this measurement noise looks like in a real world scenario. In this work, an understanding of the measurement noise is gained by taking many measurements using a commercially-availableUWBpositioning system installed in a real world scenario and analyzing these measurements in various ways. To the author's knowledge, no one has used such an exhaustive approach to analyze measurement noise in UWB indoor positioning. The results of this work show that the measurement noise that affects a UWB indoor position tracking system can be effectively modeled using a weighted sum of Gaussians, is stable over time and is locally similar. Furthermore, a particle filter augmented with a measurement noise map is proposed to improve position tracking accuracy. Finally, a metric is proposed that can be used to quantify expected system performance based on sensor location, sensor orientation and facility floorplan. Using this metric, a procedure is developed to determine the parameters, i.e. sensor position, sensor orientation and potentially others, of the physical installation of the UWB tracking system that will produce minimum measurement error based on sensor geometry and physical facility constraints.},

Although the fundamental mechanisms for localization, including AOA-, TOA-, TDOA-, and SS-based methods, apply to all radio air interface, some positioning techniques are favored by UWB-based systems using ultrawide bandwidths.},

The concept of pathloss has to be modified, and the well-known WSSUS model is not applicable anymore. The paper also describes deterministic and stochastic models for UWB channels, identifies the key parameters for the description of delay dispersion, attenuation, and directional characterization, and surveys the typical parameter values that have been measured. Measurement techniques and methods for extracting model parameters are also different in UWB channels; for example, the concepts of narrowband channel parameter estimation (e.g., maximum-likelihood estimation) have to be modified. Finally, channel models also have an important impact on the performance evaluation of various UWB systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for human presence detection and tracking using an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) impulse-based mono-static radar. UWB radar can complement other human tracking technologies, as it works well in poor visibility conditions. UWB electromagnetic wave scattering from moving humans forms a complex returned signal structure which can be approximated to a specular multi-path scattering model (SMPM). The key technical challenge is to simultaneously track multiple humans (and non-humans) using the complex scattered waveform observations. We develop a multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) framework that solves the complicated data association and tracking problem for an SMPM of moving objects/targets. Human presence detection utilizes SMPM signal features, which are tested in a classical likelihood ratio (LR) detector framework. The process of human detection and tracking is a combination of the MHT method and the LR human detector. We present experimental results in which a mono-static UWB radar tracks human and non-human targets, and detects human presence by discerning human from moving non-human objects.},

To this purpose, a number of measurement results in the form of spectrograms have been reported and discussed. They have been achieved by using a suitably-designed mechanical system emulating some specific human body movements. Hough transform has been applied to spectrograms, and the obtained results have been compared to the theoretical trajectories. Results of these comparisons show a good agreement between theoretical trajectories and measures, as well as between measures and Hough transform outcomes. This proves that the measurement system is actually efficient for human motion detection and analysis.},

However, for many modern high resolution radar systems, this density underestimates the tails of the measured clutter density. Log normal and Weibull distributions have proved to be better suited for the clutter in these high resolution radars. Generalizing the chi-square density by replacing it with the noncentral chi-square density and allowing the mean power level (the noncentrality parameter) to vary, we can both suitably shape the clutter density to produce larger tails and model the fluctuation of the average clutter power, commonly referred to as speckle. The resulting form, although appearing cumbersome, readily allows for efficient and accurate computations of the probability of detection in clutter},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach for high precision synchronization of wireless units. A concept similar to the standard FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar principle is used to estimate the offset in time and in frequency between two radar units. It allows for a synchronization of both offsets significantly below 100 ps and 10 Hz, respectively. This highly accurate synchronization is used in a prototype system to measure the distance between wireless units similar to a secondary radar. The prototype operates within the 5.8 GHz ISM-Band and uses a bandwidth of 150 MHz. With the setup presented the distance between two radar units is measured with a standard deviation of less than 4 cm over a range of 250 m. The broadband measurement principle is robust towards multipath interference. It can be extended to other frequency bands and is well-suited for direct integration into communication channels.},

The UWB is considered to have fewer influences on human being because of low transmitting power. And, MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) radar refers to an architecture that employs multiple, spatially distributed transmitters and receivers. In this paper, sensor network made up of MIMO-UWB radar with widely separated antennas to estimate distance and to detect human being existence is studied. Detection performances are evaluated from the computer simulation by using the real propagation measurement result with the network analyzer. The positioning accuracy of the human body and the effectiveness of MIMO-UWB radar are shown.},

The reflection characteristics of radio waves from a pedestrian were measured as part of the effort to improve the pedestrian detection performance of the radar sensor. A pedestrian's radio wave reflection intensity is low, at about 15-20dB less than that of the rear of a vehicle, and can vary by as much as 20dB. Evaluating these characteristics in detail is a prerequisite to the development of a radar sensor that is capable of detecting pedestrians reliably.},

However, previous studies on the impact of the human body only conducted static experiments in controlled environments. We confirm known effects and conduct real-world experiments in a typical indoor human tracking scenario using 2.4 GHz time of flight (TOF) range measurements. We analyze the effect on the raw measurements and on the localization results using the localization algorithms Centroid, NLLS, MD-Min-Max, and Geo-n. The experiment design is focused on incident management, where an infrastructure might only be installed in front of the building. We show that these effects have considerable impact on the localization accuracy of the person.},

@phdthesis{WilliamCharlesSuski2012,
abstract = {This work is motivated by the problem of improving the accuracy of indoor ultra-wideband (UWB) position tracking through the study of the environment noise that affects such a system. Current systems can provide accuracy in the range of 30-100 cm in a small building, suitable for applications that require rough room-level precision such as asset tracking and surveillance. Our long-term goal is to improve the accuracy to 1 cm or better, expanding potential applications to telepresence, augmented reality, training and entertainment. This work investigates the possibility of systematically observing the measurement noise of an UWB position tracking system and building a map of it throughout a facility. In order to understand the effect of environment noise on UWB indoor positioning and in turn filter out the effects of this noise, it is important to have an idea of what this measurement noise looks like in a real world scenario. In this work, an understanding of the measurement noise is gained by taking many measurements using a commercially-availableUWBpositioning system installed in a real world scenario and analyzing these measurements in various ways. To the author's knowledge, no one has used such an exhaustive approach to analyze measurement noise in UWB indoor positioning. The results of this work show that the measurement noise that affects a UWB indoor position tracking system can be effectively modeled using a weighted sum of Gaussians, is stable over time and is locally similar. Furthermore, a particle filter augmented with a measurement noise map is proposed to improve position tracking accuracy. Finally, a metric is proposed that can be used to quantify expected system performance based on sensor location, sensor orientation and facility floorplan. Using this metric, a procedure is developed to determine the parameters, i.e. sensor position, sensor orientation and potentially others, of the physical installation of the UWB tracking system that will produce minimum measurement error based on sensor geometry and physical facility constraints.},

It first demonstrates how the frequency selectivity of propagation processes causes fundamental differences between UWB channels and "conventional" (narrowband) channels. The concept of pathloss has to be modified, and the well-known WSSUS model is not applicable anymore. The paper also describes deterministic and stochastic models for UWB channels, identifies the key parameters for the description of delay dispersion, attenuation, and directional characterization, and surveys the typical parameter values that have been measured. Measurement techniques and methods for extracting model parameters are also different in UWB channels; for example, the concepts of narrowband channel parameter estimation (e.g., maximum-likelihood estimation) have to be modified. Finally, channel models also have an important impact on the performance evaluation of various UWB systems.},

abstract = {Human motion analysis is nowadays an appealing task of increasing interest in several application fields, like medicine and security. Many applications cover gait analysis, disaster recovery, telemetry, and surveillance. In this paper, the characterization of an ultrasound-based measurement system for human motion detection and analysis is dealt with. To this purpose, a number of measurement results in the form of spectrograms have been reported and discussed. They have been achieved by using a suitably-designed mechanical system emulating some specific human body movements. Hough transform has been applied to spectrograms, and the obtained results have been compared to the theoretical trajectories. Results of these comparisons show a good agreement between theoretical trajectories and measures, as well as between measures and Hough transform outcomes. This proves that the measurement system is actually efficient for human motion detection and analysis.},

@inproceedings{Roehr2007,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach for high precision synchronization of wireless units. A concept similar to the standard FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar principle is used to estimate the offset in time and in frequency between two radar units. It allows for a synchronization of both offsets significantly below 100 ps and 10 Hz, respectively. This highly accurate synchronization is used in a prototype system to measure the distance between wireless units similar to a secondary radar. The prototype operates within the 5.8 GHz ISM-Band and uses a bandwidth of 150 MHz. With the setup presented the distance between two radar units is measured with a standard deviation of less than 4 cm over a range of 250 m. The broadband measurement principle is robust towards multipath interference. It can be extended to other frequency bands and is well-suited for direct integration into communication channels.},
