@article{Dobson2003,
abstract = {Commercial vendors of human tracking systems tout benefits and diminish, dismiss, or deny any potential for abuse. Indeed, the benefits of location based services (LBS) are myriad, and human tracking is not all bad. However, the countless benefits of LBS are countered by social hazards unparalleled in human history. We explore possibilities for misuse that many would consider unethical. Our principal objectives are to forewarn the public, foster debate, and propose remedies. We focus primarily on hazards, reasoning that benefits get more than their due from commercial advertising, while hazards are ignored by vendors and, all too often, by public officials, as well. We describe the technologies and cite current products to demonstrate that the dangers are real, not imaginary. We illustrate the danger through realistic scenarios of potential enslavement applications. We advocate a rational response that acknowledges the benefits and inevitability of adoption along with an overwhelming need for safeguards. Finally, we propose a remedy that may prevent the most egregious abuses while, simultaneously, preserving most benefits.},

@article{Teixeira2010,
abstract = {An increasingly common requirement of computer systems is to extract information regarding the people present in an environment. In this article, we provide a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary survey of the existing literature, focusing mainly on the extraction of five commonly needed spatio- temporal properties: namely presence, count, location, track and identity. We discuss a new taxonomy of observable human properties and physical traits, along with the sensing modalities that can be used to extract them. We compare active vs. passive sensors, and single-modality vs. sensor fusion approaches, in instrumented vs. uninstrumented settings, surveying sensors as diverse as cameras, motion sensors, pressure pads, radars, electric field sensors, and wearable inertial sensors, among others. The goal of this work is to summarize the existing solutions from various disciplines, to guide the creation of new systems and point toward future research directions.},

@inproceedings{Yamada2005,
abstract = {This paper describes the results of our evaluation of a pedestrian's radio wave reflection characteristics. The reflection characteristics of radio waves from a pedestrian were measured as part of the effort to improve the pedestrian detection performance of the radar sensor. A pedestrian's radio wave reflection intensity is low, at about 15-20dB less than that of the rear of a vehicle, and can vary by as much as 20dB. Evaluating these characteristics in detail is a prerequisite to the development of a radar sensor that is capable of detecting pedestrians reliably.},
