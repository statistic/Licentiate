\section{Research Goal}
\label{ResearchGoal}
The purpose of this research is to develop a system being able to protect humans around dangerous machinery in environments like mines that conditions such as lack of light, dirt and fog cause other technologies decrease in functionality. This feature is needed in mining industry where safety requirements around automatic machineries are getting more stringent to help protecting human lives. 
%Of course the same technique can be used in other applications such as pedestrian collision protection in self driving cars.
The research goal for this thesis is:

\textit{"To design, assemble and evaluate a wireless system to be able to detect and localize humans in enclosed environments."}

This general goal can be broken down by following research questions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item [RQ1] {What are the advantages and drawbacks of the UWB radar in comparison to other sensors used in this particular application?}\\ 
\item[RQ2] {What are the characteristics of the background noise? How and how much will this noise effect the signal detection?}\\ 
\item[RQ3] {What are the algorithms to be used for detection of human with the chosen sensor?}\\
\item[RQ4] {What is the chosen sensor performance in terms of false alarms and missed detection?}\\ 
\end{enumerate}
